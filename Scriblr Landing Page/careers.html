    	<p class="mission-text"> At Scriblr one of the first things we prioritize is fit. The recruitment process to join Scriblr is two-step.</p>
    	<p class="mission-text"> The first thing we'll evaluate your portfolio and resumes and filter out those we feel have the skillset to excel with our team. We realize that as an early-stage startup, highly skilled individuals will be difficult to recruit so we are targetting young students and graduates who want to find a place to grow and hone their skills by working with like-minded people.</p>
    	<p class="mission-text"> The second step will be a ten minute personal interview over video-call to gauge the personality fit. Scriblr is just starting up, but we want to make sure every member we add to the team fits in.</p>
